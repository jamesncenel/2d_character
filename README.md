# 2d_character
Here is my program that demonstrates a 2D character made from Bezier polygons, and then the tangent of the character at each point.

You need Wolfram Mathematica to view this. If you have it, open this file in Mathematica, and then use Shift + Enter to run the file and see the output.

Note: You can only have one notebook open at a time in Mathematica. If you have more than one open at once, it may cause errors when executing any of them.
